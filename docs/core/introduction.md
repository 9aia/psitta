## What is Psitta?

Psitta is a modern Web internationalization framework designed to be [ESM-only](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), type-safe, machine-translatable and provide easy-to-use i18n common tasks based on the [Intl Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl). In simple terms, it wraps around Web APIs to simplify the localization of messages, URLs, and values. Psitta also includes support for locale detection and automatic translation.

## What About Other I18n Frameworks?

Psitta has been started as a side project to experiment with a non-polluted approach to keys, using human-language keys instead. It's primarily designed to work well with small personal projects (which is recommended), rather than large enterprise software. For larger projects, other i18n frameworks may be more suitable.
